A machine learning–based web application that predicts **HSC (Higher Secondary Certificate) results** for Bangladeshi students using historical academic and socio-economic data.
The system is built using a **Random Forest Regression model** and deployed with **Gradio** for an interactive user interface.

## 📌 Project Overview

Predicting student performance can help educators, students, and guardians understand potential academic outcomes early.This project uses machine learning to estimate a student's **HSC GPA** based on factors such as:

- Demographic information
- Family background
- Parental education and occupation
- Lifestyle factors
- SSC academic performance

⚠️ **Note:** This application is intended for **educational and research purposes only**.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **Problem Type:** Regression
- **Target Variable:** HSC Result (GPA)
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Regressor

### Why Random Forest?

- Handles non-linear relationships well
- Robust to noise and overfitting
- Works effectively with mixed feature types
- Provides strong baseline performance for tabular data

---

## 🧾 Input Features

The model takes the following inputs:

### 🔢 Numerical Features

- Age
- Tuition Fee
- Time Spent with Friends
- SSC Result (GPA)

### 🔤 Categorical Features

- Gender
- Address (Urban / Rural)
- Family Size
- Parents' Living Status
- Mother’s Education Level
- Father’s Education Level
- Mother’s Occupation
- Father’s Occupation
- Relationship Status
- Smoker

All preprocessing (encoding, imputation, scaling) is handled using a **Scikit-learn Pipeline**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Joblib
  - Gradio
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (EDA)
  - ydata-profiling (EDA)
